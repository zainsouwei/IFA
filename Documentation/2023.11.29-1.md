## Algorithm Design

### Developments

* The reason we do dual in SPADE ICA pipeline is because we are working with VEV' covairance matrix initially where in classic ICA we have the data and can project onto SVD components of choosing form UEV'
*   All of these are valid/useful

*   However our main pipeline/generation of the independent filter analysis is

### Questions

* [ ] Are SPADE Filters orthogonal
* [ ] How to best generalize to individual/no reference group case
* [ ] LDA vs FKT vs LDA/FKT vs Bhattacharyya distance/Fischer Discriminant Criteria
* [ ] Bhattacharyya distance
* [ ] Computational cost of running ICA number of subject tiems vs once and then doing dual regression. Maybe doesnt matter cause can donit for subject of interest.&#x20;
* [ ] Do the discrimination before ICA. Which means we are looking for low order discrimination. Which then means is the benefit of CC ICA that we look for higher order discrimination? How does CC-ICA performance compare/enforcing learning rule in the criterion

### ToDo

### ToDo

* [ ] Fix code so that project data back onto filters even in single subject case
