# Algorithm Questions

* [ ] Are the [spatial filters](https://github.com/zainsouwei/ICASPADE/blob/21adaa891aab69852804d4ae05bb6f2460be63d4/simulate\_time.py#L81C1-L83C6) always orthogonal with our data?
* [ ] Are SPADE Filters orthogonal
* [ ] How to best generalize to individual/no reference group case
* [ ] LDA vs FKT vs LDA/FKT vs Bhattacharyya distance/Fischer Discriminant Criteria
* [ ] Bhattacharyya distance
* [ ] Computational cost of running ICA number of subject tiems vs once and then doing dual regression. Maybe doesnt matter cause can donit for subject of interest.
* [ ] Do the discrimination before ICA. Which means we are looking for low order discrimination. Which then means is the benefit of CC ICA that we look for higher order discrimination? How does CC-ICA performance compare/enforcing learning rule in the criterion
* [ ] How should we be denoising? This method seems prone to site effects
* [ ] What happens if all the discriminatory information is represented by higher-order information? I think it still might work in the case you view it as a linear approximation
* [ ] What is our extension of SPADE/what part of the pipeline? What are the works related to it? How does it differ/what are the benefits of this method?
* [ ] How to best generalize to individual/no reference group case?
* [ ] Is the best way to generalize to no reference group case one v all, pairwise comparisons, or add all separate covariance matrices?
* [ ] Look into group FKT paper
