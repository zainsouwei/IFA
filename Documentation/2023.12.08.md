## General Notes



## Algorithm Design

### Developments

* When adding future extensions/variants, the main changes should be in the
  * Discrimination - Current FKT
    * Kernel Discriminatory Analysis
    * Kernel PCA
  * Explanation - Current ICA
    * PROFUMO
    * Dictionary Learning

### Questions

* [ ] How should we be denoising? This method seems prone to site effects
* [ ] What happens if all the discriminatory information is represented by higher-order information? I think it still might work in the case you view it as a linear approximation
