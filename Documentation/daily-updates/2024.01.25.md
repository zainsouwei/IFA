### Developments

* Covariance Edge Cases
  * Group A has the same time series in parcels x,y,z. Group B has different time series in parcels x,y,z.&#x20;
    * This will cause inv(groupA+groupB)\*Group A covariance matrix to have high off diagonal elements and low on diagonal elements on x,y,z which will result in one discriminant component for group A. However, inv(groupA+groupB)\*group B will have low off diagonal elements for parcels x,y,z but high elements on the diagonal for x,y,z which will cause group B to have 3 components. Since the 3 components from Group B can be used to form the component from Group A, ICA might split the Group A component
  * Group A has the same time series in x,y,z, and Group B has the same time series in x,y,z. The time series between Group A and Group B are different but have the same total energy causing same covariance matrices
  * Group A has the same time series in x,y,z and Group B has random noise in X,Y,Z. Random noise will have a higher variance and a lower covariance than other parcels, making it a more dominant feature in Group B than it is in Group A.
