* [ ] Where to demean/how to demean both rows and columns? Should I always have ddof=1? [https://rwalk.xyz/can-you-norm-rows-and-standardize-columns-at-the-same-time/](https://rwalk.xyz/can-you-norm-rows-and-standardize-columns-at-the-same-time/)
* [ ] Look at FKT\_proj. Let X be data. Dual projection (XF).TX  = (UEV'F)'UEV' = F'VEEV' . Now the variance from X is being squared. So I'm thinking maybe project via dropping E from first projection or last projection but that seems wrong. So i thought maybe taking svd of (UEV'F) and then using the left and right singular vectors to project in that way. But I am not sure about this either. I think you cant just not square the singular values from the first projection because covariance of that is VEEV'FF'VEEV' . And F is not orthogonal. I am not sure though
