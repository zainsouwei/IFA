## General Notes

## Algorithm Design

### Developments

* Quantifying Variance/Discrimination
  * Quantifying Discrimination of PCA on Group-Concatenated Data
    * running PCA for model order selection and then FKT, and hopefully showing that as the model order is increased, FKT can find filters with higher discrimination (given the discriminatory information lies in the low variance eigenspace)
  * Quantifying Variance of FKT
    * quantify the amount of variance that the eigenvectors from the FKT after dual regression express of the full data (ie if you did an F-ratio test between the total projected data on the FKT vectors relative to the full variance)
    * That way individual vectors do not matter and instead you are comparing the volume of the space collectively spanned by the FKT/â€™PCA vectors independent on how precisely they span that space

### Questions

* Would it be worth considering using dictionary learning instead of the ICP atlas in the normal FKT+ICA pipeline so an atlas would not need to provided or allow for the option? Or in that case would it be better to use a publicly available atlas as the default?

## Code

### Developments

### ToDo

* [ ] Check the regularized covariance matrix and degrees of freedom used when calculating variance and std. When I compute covariance matrix of standardized subjects I use ddof = 0, but when I do it for concatenated standardized subjects i use ddof = 1. Is HCP standaridized, if so should i use ddof everywhere? I only demean across samples, should I demean or standardize across parcels anywhere
