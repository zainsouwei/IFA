### Questions

* [ ] Which Fisher Discriminant based method to choose? Foley Sammon and FKT although similary make different uses/lack of uses of the mean. Additionally, in tradational FKT it was proposed that you use R which includes mean magnitude not mean direction so if there are positive and negative values then FKT might not be optimal. Is this something to be concerned about? HTC might be good for multiclass as well. I want to say no since we are not using the autocorrelation matrices and I think our data is demeaned but maybe something to look into
