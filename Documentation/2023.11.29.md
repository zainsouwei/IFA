## General Notes

* A rough draft of all the potential SPADE pipelines is complete. I will talk with Christian to see which is the one we want and then refine it from there. Currently, what is contained in [simulate\_time.py](https://github.com/zainsouwei/ICASPADE/blob/main/simulate\_time.py) is the rough draft of the pipelines. Debugging/optimization needs to happen everywhere when moving forward with any of the pipeline.

## Algorithm Design

### Developments

### Questions

* [ ] What is our extension of SPADE/what part of the pipeline? What are the works related to it? How does it differ/what are the benefits of this method?

### Developments

### ToDo

* [x] Make initial run work for group-level
* [ ] [Change the dual regression from checking if it is the single subject case or group](https://github.com/zainsouwei/ICASPADE/blob/21adaa891aab69852804d4ae05bb6f2460be63d4/simulate\_time.py#L96C3-L99C49). Dual regression is only used in the group case now
