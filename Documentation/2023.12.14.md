### Questions

* [ ] Could you make it completely unsupervised by doing one v all and then compare filters? Do pairwise and then group together observations (can do something like pairs whose trace of eigenvalue matrix from filters is less than threshold are assumed to be close together ... or can make distance matrix by making entries between observations be trace of eigenvalue matrix of filters and then visualize via MDS)?
