### Questions

* [ ] Could you make it completely unsupervised by doing one vs. all and then comparing filters? Do pairwise and then group together observations (can do something like pairs, whose trace of eigenvalue matrix from filters is less than a threshold, are assumed to be close together ... or can make distance matrix by making entries between observations be the trace of eigenvalue matrix (of maybe first k filters or) or avg variance of difference from .5 of filters and then visualize via MDS) - maybe should not be trace since trace explains variance. If discriminative components do not make up much variance it might be poorly representative but since MDS would compare all traces maybe it's fine? [Could it potentially be viewed as a manifold learning approach](https://yao-lab.github.io/2019\_csic5011/slides/lecture13\_key.pdf)?
